### Home security system proof of concept

Burhg was envisioned as a solution to current home security systems that are plagued with many false alarms.

Our system makes use of the DeepStack AI to do image detection and a motion detection algorithm from opencv to make object tracking more efficient so we can track multiple 
humans at a higher frame rate than would be possible with only the AI. Our system keeps track of how many people enters and exits a "house" for instance where we mark the 
position of the entrance with a painted image. We worked for about two weeks to get a rough proof of concept working.
